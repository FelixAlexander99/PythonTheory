# PythonTheory
Python Learning Repository

This repository contains a (not so) comprehensive collection of Python scripts created throughout the process of learning the language. It serves as a structured showcase of essential Python concepts, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced programming techniques.

Overview

The code within this repository demonstrates the practical use of Python’s core features and standard libraries. Each file was written as part of a progressive learning process, covering the fundamental building blocks of Python development. The scripts are organized by topic and are meant to be both educational and referential for anyone revisiting the language’s foundational concepts.

Topics Covered

This repository includes examples and exercises covering a broad range of Python topics, such as:

Basic Syntax and Data Types – variables, strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

Control Flow – conditional statements, loops, and iteration techniques

Functions – definition, scope, recursion, and lambda expressions

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism

Modules and Packages – importing, structuring, and reusing code

File Handling – reading, writing, and managing text and binary files

Error and Exception Handling – using try, except, finally, and custom exceptions

Regular Expressions (Regex) – pattern matching and text processing

Comprehensions and Generators – efficient ways to build and iterate over data structures

Decorators and Iterators – advanced techniques for abstraction and functional programming

Working with External Libraries – basic examples of leveraging Python’s ecosystem

Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to consolidate the entire learning experience into one place — a reference point for Python’s key concepts and best practices. While the scripts were written for self-education, they can also serve as learning material for beginners seeking hands-on examples or for experienced developers looking to revisit the fundamentals.
